# Audio Sources

All in-game audio under `static/assets/audio/` is procedurally generated in-repo using:

- `scripts/generate_audio_assets.mjs`

Generated outputs:
- BGM tracks: `static/assets/audio/bgm/*.wav`
- Interaction SFX: `static/assets/audio/sfx/*.wav`

Licensing/provenance:
- Original generated waveforms created locally at build-time.
- No third-party samples or copyrighted stems are included.
