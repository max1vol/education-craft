# Agent Notes

## Running the game
- When asked to run or launch the game, use `tmux` and run `npm run dev` from the repo root.
- Before starting a new server, check whether it is already running in `tmux`; do not start duplicates.
- Prefer keeping the game server in `tmux` at all times so logs are easy to inspect.
- When the game is run/launched, always remind the user of the local URL printed by `npm run dev`.
